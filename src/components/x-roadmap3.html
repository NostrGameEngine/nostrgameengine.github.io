            <p>
                Full backward compatibility with jMonkeyEngine is dropped as the engine shifts toward
                a more modern architecture with programmable pipelines at its core, giving developers
                full control over the execution flow.
            </p>
            <p>
                The primary rendering technique is switched to tile‑based deferred rendering to improve
                performance with complex lighting and high‑resolution (4K+) rendering.
            </p>
            <p>
                The engine internals are cleaned up and refactored; deprecated features are removed and
                the codebase is prepared for upcoming releases.
