            <h3>Summary of the first phase</h3>
            During the initial development phase, the Nostr Game Engine was bootstrapped from the <b>jMonkeyEngine</b> codebase,
            enhanced, and integrated with several traditional and Nostr-powered features:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The original network stack was fully replaced with a
                    <a href="https://github.com/NostrGameEngine/ngengine/tree/master/nge-networking">peer-to-peer
                        architecture</a>
                    powered by
                    <a
                        href="https://github.com/NostrGameEngine/nostr4j/tree/master/nostr4j/src/main/java/org/ngengine/nostr4j/rtc">
                        Nostr signaling
                    </a>, enabling decentralized, permissionless connectivity between players.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A modular component-based architecture was implemented, allowing developers to easily write reusable code
                    and share it across projects.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Core Nostr functionality was implemented via <a href="https://github.com/NostrGameEngine/nostr4j">nostr4j</a>,
                    a purpose-built high-performance and memory efficient client library developed from scratch.
                </li>
                <li>
                        A <a href="https://nostr-ads.ngengine.org/">Nostr-based advertising system</a> was created, both
                        as an <a href="https://ngengine.org/docs/ads/">engine module</a> and as a standalone library, allowing
                        developers to integrate permissionless advertising into their games and applications.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://ngengine.org/docs/network/lobby/">Matchmaking</a> and
                    <a href="https://ngengine.org/docs/network/player/#fetching-player-instances">player profile management</a>
                    have been implemented over Nostr, leveraging its decentralized event model for identity persistence and
                    social discovery without centralized servers.
                </li>
                <li>
                        A <a href="https://ngengine.org/docs/auth/">managed authentication subsystem</a> was developed,
                        capable of automatically authenticating players using <b>NIP-07</b>, <b>NIP-46</b>, or locally encrypted
                        private keys.
                </li>
              
            </ul>

        Multiple <b>upstream patches and extensions</b> were applied to <b>jMonkeyEngine</b>, enhancing its
        overall performance, feature set, and <b>Android support</b>.
            <br>

            Furthermore, the entire engine was <a
                href="https://github.com/NostrGameEngine/ngengine/tree/master/nge-web">
                ported to WebGL2</a> and modern web technologies via <b>TeaVM</b>, enabling
            cross-compilation to JavaScript with near-native performance. This makes it possible to deploy NGE-based
            games directly to browsers, no installation required.
            <br><br>

            Finally, a comprehensive <a href="https://github.com/NostrGameEngine/nge-app-template">
                build and deployment</a> Gradle template was integrated into the engine’s app template. This
            toolchain supports packaging for all target platforms and enables deployment to <b>Nostr-based static
                websites</b> through the third-party service <a href="https://github.com/sepehr-safari/nostr-deploy-cli">nostrdeploy</a>.
            <br><br>

            <h3>Overview of the second phase</h3>
            The second phase will first
            focus on integrating some additional Nostr-based social features, expanding the engine’s
            capabilities and strengthening its multiplayer and community-driven components.
            <br><br>
            After that, development
            will concentrate on improving abstractions and developer accessibility. This stage aims
            to make the engine more intuitive for newcomers.<br>Video tutorials, documentation, and example projects will
            be created to showcase the engine’s features and support the development of Nostr-powered games and
            applications.
            <br><br>

            Then, the second phase will proceed by extending the engine 
            to support Bitcoin-based
             micropayments, VR applications, and
            interoperability between
            games and experiences, allowing them to connect and integrate over Nostr.
            <br><br><br><br><br>

            
            The roadmap for the second phase and beyond is outlined below, while the full roadmap that includes all the details 
            of the completed first phase, is available on the <a href="/">home
                page</a>.
            <br><br>

            <i>Note: some of the following tasks (marked with an highlighted dot) were completed early during the first phase for practical reasons.</i>
            <sub>Note: This roadmap contains some AI-generated imagery as placeholders. As development progresses they
                will be replaced with actual engine screenshots and videos.</sub>

        <h2>Educational Interlude</h2>
        <p>
            Enough features are in place to start building games and apps.
            <br>
            We'll pause new feature development to focus on improving accessibility, 
            education and outreach, creating tutorials and videos that showcase
            the
            engine and help new developers get started.
