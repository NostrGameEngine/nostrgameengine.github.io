            <h3>Summary of the first phase</h3>
            During the initial development phase, the Nostr Game Engine was bootstrapped from the
            <b>jMonkeyEngine</b>
            codebase.

            <br>
            <br>

            The original network stack was fully replaced with a
            <a href="https://github.com/NostrGameEngine/ngengine/tree/master/nge-networking">peer-to-peer
                architecture</a>
            powered by
            <a
                href="https://github.com/NostrGameEngine/nostr4j/tree/master/nostr4j/src/main/java/org/ngengine/nostr4j/rtc">
                Nostr signaling
            </a>, enabling decentralized, permissionless connectivity between players.
            <br><br>

            Core Nostr functionality was implemented via <a
                href="https://github.com/NostrGameEngine/nostr4j">nostr4j</a>,
            a purpose-built client library developed from scratch.
            This
            library provides full support for advanced Nostr capabilities, including <b>NWC</b>, <b>Blossom</b>, and
            other Nostr
            extensions.
            <br><br>


            A <a href="https://nostr-ads.ngengine.org/">Nostr-based advertising system</a> was also created—both
            as an <a href="https://ngengine.org/docs/ads/">engine module</a> and as a standalone library, allowing
            developers to integrate permissionless ad networks directly into their games or related applications.
            <br><br>


            <a href="https://ngengine.org/docs/network/lobby/">Matchmaking</a> and
            <a href="https://ngengine.org/docs/network/player/#fetching-player-instances">player profile
                management</a>
            have been fully implemented over Nostr, leveraging its decentralized
            event model to enable identity persistence and social discovery without centralized servers.
            <br><br>


            The engine now includes a <a href="https://ngengine.org/docs/auth/">managed authentication subsystem</a>
            capable of automatically authenticating players using
            <b>NIP-07</b>, <b>NIP-46</b>, or locally encrypted private keys.
            <br>
            <br>

            Multiple <b>upstream patches and extensions</b> were applied to <b>jMonkeyEngine</b>, enhancing its
            overall performance,
            feature set, and <b></b>Android support</b>.
            <br>
            <br>

            Furthermore, the entire engine was <a
                href="https://github.com/NostrGameEngine/ngengine/tree/master/nge-web">
                ported to WebGL2</a> and modern web technologies via <b>TeaVM</b>, enabling
            cross-compilation to JavaScript with near-native performance. This makes it possible to deploy NGE-based
            games directly
            in browsers. No installation required.
            <br><br>


            Finally, a comprehensive <a href="https://github.com/NostrGameEngine/nge-app-template">
                build and deployment system</a> gradle template was integrated into the engine’s app template. This
            toolchain
            supports packaging for all target platforms and enables seamless deployment to <b>Nostr-based static
                websites</b>
            through the third-party service <a href="https://nostrdeploy.com">nostrdeploy</a>.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>


            <h3>Overview of the second phase</h3>
            The second phase will focus on integrating additional Nostr-based social features, expanding the engine’s
            capabilities and strengthening its multiplayer and community-driven components.
            <br>
            <br>
            A subsequent stage will concentrate on improving abstractions and developer accessibility. This phase aims
            to make the
            engine more intuitive and easier to use, particularly for newcomers. During this period, video tutorials,
            documentation,
            and example projects will be developed to showcase the engine’s features and support the creation of
            Nostr-powered games
            and applications.
            <br><br>

            Later stages will extend the engine to support Bitcoin based micro-payments and VR applications and enable
            interoperability between
            games and experiences, allowing them to connect and integrate over Nostr.
            <br><br>

            The complete roadmap, including details of the completed first phase, is available on the <a href="/">home
                page</a>.

                Note: This roadmap contains some AI generated imagery as placeholders,
                as the roadmap progresses they will be
                replaced
                with
                actual engine screenshots and videos.

        <h2>Educational Interlude</h2>
        <p>
            Enough features are in place to start building interesting games and apps.
            <br>
            We'll take a break from adding new features to focus on education and outreach by creating
            detailed tutorials and videos that showcase the engine capabilities and help new developers get started
            building
            nostr
            powered games and applications.
