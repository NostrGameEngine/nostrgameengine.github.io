            <h3>Summary of the first phase</h3>
            During the initial development phase, the Nostr Game Engine was bootstrapped from the <b>jMonkeyEngine</b>
            codebase.
            <br><br>

            The original network stack was fully replaced with a
            <a href="https://github.com/NostrGameEngine/ngengine/tree/master/nge-networking">peer-to-peer
                architecture</a>
            powered by
            <a
                href="https://github.com/NostrGameEngine/nostr4j/tree/master/nostr4j/src/main/java/org/ngengine/nostr4j/rtc">
                Nostr signaling
            </a>, enabling decentralized, permissionless connectivity between players.
            <br><br>

            Core Nostr functionality was implemented via <a
                href="https://github.com/NostrGameEngine/nostr4j">nostr4j</a>,
            a purpose-built client library developed from scratch. This library provides support for advanced Nostr
            capabilities, including <b>NWC</b>, <b>Blossom</b>, and other extensions.
            <br><br>

            A <a href="https://nostr-ads.ngengine.org/">Nostr-based advertising system</a> was also created—both
            as an <a href="https://ngengine.org/docs/ads/">engine module</a> and as a standalone library—allowing
            developers to integrate permissionless ad networks directly into their games or related applications.
            <br><br>

            <a href="https://ngengine.org/docs/network/lobby/">Matchmaking</a> and
            <a href="https://ngengine.org/docs/network/player/#fetching-player-instances">player profile management</a>
            have been implemented over Nostr, leveraging its decentralized event model for identity persistence and
            social discovery without centralized servers.
            <br><br>

            The engine now includes a <a href="https://ngengine.org/docs/auth/">managed authentication subsystem</a>
            capable of automatically authenticating players using <b>NIP-07</b>, <b>NIP-46</b>, or locally encrypted
            private keys.
            <br><br>

            Multiple <b>upstream patches and extensions</b> were applied to <b>jMonkeyEngine</b>, enhancing its
            overall performance, feature set, and <b>Android support</b>.
            <br><br>

            Furthermore, the entire engine was <a
                href="https://github.com/NostrGameEngine/ngengine/tree/master/nge-web">
                ported to WebGL2</a> and modern web technologies via <b>TeaVM</b>, enabling
            cross-compilation to JavaScript with near-native performance. This makes it possible to deploy NGE-based
            games directly in browsers—no installation required.
            <br><br>

            Finally, a comprehensive <a href="https://github.com/NostrGameEngine/nge-app-template">
                build and deployment system</a> Gradle template was integrated into the engine’s app template. This
            toolchain supports packaging for all target platforms and enables deployment to <b>Nostr-based static
                websites</b> through the third-party service <a href="https://nostrdeploy.com">nostrdeploy</a>.
            <br><br><br>

            <h3>Overview of the second phase</h3>
            The second phase will focus on integrating additional Nostr-based social features, expanding the engine’s
            capabilities and strengthening its multiplayer and community-driven components.
            <br><br>
            A subsequent stage will concentrate on improving abstractions and developer accessibility. This stage aims
            to make the engine more intuitive for newcomers. Video tutorials, documentation, and example projects will
            be created to showcase the engine’s features and support the development of Nostr-powered games and
            applications.
            <br><br>

            Later stages will extend the engine to support Bitcoin-based micropayments, VR applications, and
            interoperability between
            games and experiences, allowing them to connect and integrate over Nostr.

                page</a>.

            <sub>Note: some tasks were completed early during the first phase for practical reasons.</sub>
            <sub>Note: This roadmap contains some AI-generated imagery as placeholders. As development progresses they
                will be replaced with actual engine screenshots and videos.</sub>

        <h2>Educational Interlude</h2>
        <p>
            Enough features are in place to start building games and apps.
            <br>
            We'll pause new feature development to focus on education and outreach, creating tutorials and videos that showcase
            the
            engine and help new developers get started.
